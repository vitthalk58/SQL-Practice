create table emp
 ( "empno" int primary key,
   "ename" varchar(20),
   "deptname" varchar(20),
   "sal" int);


Values inserted in the table 

insert into emp values(1,'vithal','IT',10000)

1. Find second/Third/fourth highest sal from each department

    a) with CTE as (select *, ROW_NUMBER() over(partition by deptname order by sal DESC) as 
       rn from emp)
       select * from CTE where rn=2;

    B)with CTE as (select *, DENSE_RANK() over(partition by deptname order by sal DESC) as rn   
      from emp)
      select * from CTE where rn=2

2. Find the cumulative sum of employee salary

   select empno,ename,sal,sum(sal) over(order by empno) from emp;

3. Write a query to fetch emp sal with last two digits as XX.

   A) SELECT 
    ename, 
    sal, 
    CONCAT(SUBSTRING(sal::TEXT FROM 1 FOR LENGTH(sal::TEXT) - 2), 'XX') AS masked_sal
    FROM emp;

  B) select ename,
        sal,
 CONCAT(substring(sal::text FROM 1 FOR LENGTH(sal::text) -2),'xx')as masked_sal from emp
